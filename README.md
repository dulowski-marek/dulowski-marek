I'm a director and solutions architect at Skalable.

I work with web technologies and software engineering teams. I fix sytem architecture,
improve engineering processes, hire and manage high-performing teams.

I'm an advocate of Clean Code and Clean Architecture. 
I've had commercial experience with all the major frontend frameworks and UI libraries, 
numerous backend languages (JS, Java, Golang, Kotlin), multiplatform (KMP), 
mobile and some hands-on exposure to AI and blockchain.
